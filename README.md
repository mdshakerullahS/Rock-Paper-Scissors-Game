# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
<br>
A fun and interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game features a simple, clean UI styled with CSS and dynamic game logic using JavaScript. It includes real-time score tracking, random computer choices, and result display after each round. This project helped me practice conditional logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling in JavaScript.
